# bookstats

Book Stats is my first coding project.

This will return data on books and literature input into, such as individual character and word counts. Simply designate the location of a text file using the command 

python3 main.py books/"filename.txt"

Replace "filename.txt" in its entirety with the relevant file name you would like to analyze.
